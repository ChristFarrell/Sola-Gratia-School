This is a midterm exam project. The project I created is a simple school website. This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one external code. Overall, this website requires HTML and CSS code to work. Javascript code is used to toggle hamburger buttons on a small screen. Javascript is also used for button code, in replacing images and text. There is a server.js that contains code for running the server using Deno.

In addition, one external code function (GoogleScript) is used to save form data from the "Contact" section. You can go to the "contact.html" page to fill in the data. When submitted, the data will be saved in table form in Google Sheets. Here is the Google Sheets link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGdkPJmyNQMj1D9UmIawUndGzSODW3Tym0G073W_eUA/edit?usp=drivesdk
